# Impact-of-CLustering-Algorithms-in-Predicting-Topics

Social media has become a major platform to express opinions for the majority of the people. Among all the platforms available, Twitter is one of the most popular ones. Several methods are proposed in the literature to extract information from tweets. Topic identification is one of the methods. This research is to examine how the algorithms used for topic identification affect the findings. The analysis is made by extracting a vast amount of tweets from Twitter.
For our analysis, we have used clustering Algorithms K Means, LDA, and NMF(Negative Matrix Factorization) for clustering and NLTK(Natural Language Tool Kit)  to determine the topic name of each cluster. Topic names found for the clusters produced by the three algorithms were analyzed for similarity. Adjusted Rand Index(ARI) is used as the similarity measure of algorithms. Based on this LDA and NMF were close. To estimate the appropriateness of the topic names to the underlying clusters word similarity measure is used. This analysis indicates the topics generated by the K-means are better representations of the clusters produced than the other algorithms
